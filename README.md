Following [this tutorial](http://roguebasin.roguelikedevelopment.org/index.php/Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod) on programming a rogue-like in Python using [libtcod](http://doryen.eptalys.net/libtcod/).

Departing quite a bit in my code organization, taking a more modular, OO approach.
